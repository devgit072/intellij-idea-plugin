Plugin on Intellij-Idea platform is utility which comes with certain features and it can help boosting
productivity while doing coding. For-example: Auto-completion, generating code etc.

In this tutorials we will learn how to develop a plugin on Intellij Idea. A plugin on intellij-idea can
be developed using Java or Kotlin(new kid in the JVM block!!).

We will develop plugin for 
* Action : Select the given keyword on search on google.com
* Auto-Completion in *.yaml/*.yml file.
* Generate Code/Boilerplate snippet in java file.

We will put plenty of code to make the code self-documentation.

To implement auto-completion, there are two ways:
* Use JsonSchema which is simple to implement, effective and easy way. 
However, it has less control over the cursor and hence less powerful.
* Implement code completion using code. It is tedious(for beginners) to implement, but a more engaging auto-completion 
can be implemented. We can have more control over the cursor.

To implement generation of boiler-plate code generation, we can use live-template xml file.

Anyway it is easy and fun to develop a plugin on Intellij-Idea platform and once you learn 
how to develop a plugin, you can develop a plugin in future which suits your requirements.
